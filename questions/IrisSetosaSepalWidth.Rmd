Question
========

This question is tricky and I included it only to show that in real life, the concepts are not always as clear-cut as in the exercises. Don't worry if you got this particular one wrong.
What is the skewness of the distribution displayed on the below plot?
\
```{r txhousing, echo=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.path = "", fig.cap = "House sales transactions in Texas (2000-2015)"}
data(iris)
iris %>% 
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_density(fill="lightgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)) +
  ggtitle("Sepal Width of Iris Setosa") +
  xlab("Sepal width") +
  ylab("")
```
